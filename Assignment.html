    <marquee><h1>Quick Hummus Recipe</h1></marquee>
   <fieldset>
     <strong><p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapter from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p></strong>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans).</li>
    <li>175g of tahini.</li>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper.</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper.</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic.</li>
    <li>A dash of olive oil.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.</li>
        <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.</li>
        <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor.</li>
        <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
        <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.</li>
        <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
    </ul>
   
    
    <strong><p1>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chilipepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p1></strong>
    
    <h3>Storage</h3>
    
    <li>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container.</li>
    <li>You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it.</li> 
    <li>If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</li>
    <li>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</li>
